Routine Execution

## Prompt
Create a new dashboard called "Customer Insights". Add the existing saved
question "Top Customers by Orders" to the dashboard. Then add a Date filter
widget to the dashboard and connect it to an appropriate date column (such as
"Created At") so users can filter the data by date range. Save the dashboard.

## Expected Result
- A dashboard named "Customer Insights" exists and is accessible from the
  home page or "Our analytics" collection
- It contains the "Top Customers by Orders" question as a card
- A date filter widget is visible at the top of the dashboard
- Selecting a date range in the filter updates the displayed data
- The dashboard is saved and persists on page reload

## Seed Data Required
- Metabase is set up with admin user (admin@example.com / Admin123!)
- Sample Database is connected and synced
- "Top Customers by Orders" saved question exists (created by the seed script)
